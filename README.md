# Contract Query Chatbot

## Project Description
This project is a B2B Contract Query Chatbot built using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. The chatbot assists users in querying contract-related information between B2B vendors. It utilizes Langchain for retrieval and response generation, and ChromaDB for efficient document storage and retrieval. The chatbot is designed with guardrails to ensure that responses are contextually relevant and accurate.
